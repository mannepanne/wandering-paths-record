# Documentation Standards

Reference guide for creating project documentation.

## Purpose of Documentation

- Enable picking up a project later and quickly understanding how everything works
- Communicate knowledge and expertise to others
- Ensure work is not lost when moving on to other projects
- Preferred output format: Markdown (.md)

## Documentation Analysis Areas

When creating documentation, focus on these areas:

1. Code structure and purpose
2. Inputs, outputs, and behavior
3. User interaction flows
4. Edge cases and error handling
5. Integration points with other components/systems

## Documentation Process

1. Analyze the target code thoroughly
2. Identify all public interfaces
3. Document expected behaviors
4. Include code examples
5. Add diagrams where helpful
6. Follow project documentation standards
7. Ensure clarity, completeness, and actionability

## Documentation Template

Essential headings for technical documentation:

- **Overview**: Brief 1-2 paragraph overview explaining purpose and value
- **Usage**: How to use this component/feature with examples
- **API/Parameters**: Detailed specification of interfaces
- **Behavior**: Expected behavior in different scenarios
- **Error Handling**: How errors are caught, handled, and reported
- **Testing**: How to test this component/feature
- **Related Components**: Links to related documentation
