# Technology Stack and Choices

Reference guide for selecting technologies across projects.

## General Preferences

- Free or low cost solutions are always preferred
- We prefer state-of-the-art solutions, but avoid experimental code or beta versions (unless nothing else is available)
- Never use outdated or deprecated solutions
- If a suitable technology doesn't seem to be available, recommend running a deep research task first to understand the topic better and find potential alternatives
- For any selected framework, library, third party component, API or other service, read the manual to ensure you use the latest stable version and follow best practice usage and patterns
