# Full-Stack Developer PR Review

This skill provides a comprehensive pull request review from an experienced full-stack developer perspective, covering code quality, security, functionality, and best practices.

## How This Works

A single expert full-stack developer reviews the PR and provides actionable feedback.

---

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked with a PR number (e.g., `/review-pr 2`):

### Step 1: Spawn Code Reviewer Agent

**CRITICAL:** You must spawn an independent subagent for this review. DO NOT review the PR yourself in this session. The reviewer needs fresh, unbiased context.

Spawn the **`code-reviewer`** subagent with this task:

**Task:** "Conduct a comprehensive code review of PR #$ARGUMENTS. Follow your review checklist and output format. Post nothing — return your full findings when done."

Wait for the review to complete.

---

### Step 2: Post Results

After the review is complete:

Post the review as a comment on the PR using:

```bash
gh pr comment $ARGUMENTS --body "[markdown content from review]"
```

Provide user summary:
- Total issues found (critical vs suggestions)
- Clear recommendation (approve/request changes)
- Key action items
- Link to PR comment

---

## Example Usage

```
/review-pr 2
```

This will:
1. Spawn independent full-stack developer reviewer
2. Reviewer gathers their own context (PR details, CLAUDE.md, specs, changed files)
3. Reviewer conducts comprehensive review
4. Post review to PR #2
