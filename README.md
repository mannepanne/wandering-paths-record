## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start development servers (run both commands in separate terminals)
npm run dev          # Frontend development server
node server.cjs      # Local API server for restaurant extraction

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to production (CloudFlare Workers)
npx wrangler deploy
```
