## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- npm

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal, start the local API server for restaurant extraction
node server.cjs

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Environment Setup

For full functionality, you'll need:

1. **Claude API Key**: Add `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` to your `.env` file (for restaurant extraction)
2. **Supabase Configuration**: Add Supabase URL and anon key to `.env`
3. **Mapbox Access Token**: Add `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `.env` (for interactive maps)
4. **Local API Server**: Run `node server.cjs` alongside the frontend development server

```bash
# .env file
VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
```
