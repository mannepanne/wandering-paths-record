## Asset Reference Issue - SOLVED

### Problem
The CloudFlare Worker was serving hardcoded HTML with outdated asset references (like `index-C1ecQnNk.js`), causing the site to fail loading on production with MIME type and 404 errors.

### Root Cause
The issue was in `src/worker.js` where the `indexHtmlContent` was hardcoded and never updated when new assets were built. Each Vite build generates new asset hashes, but the Worker HTML template wasn't being synchronized.

### Solution
**Automatic Asset Reference Updates**

1. **Modified `src/worker.js`**: Replaced hardcoded asset references with placeholders:
   ```javascript
   <!-- ASSET_PLACEHOLDER_SCRIPT -->
   <!-- ASSET_PLACEHOLDER_CSS -->
   ```

2. **Created `scripts/update-worker-assets.js`**: Post-build script that:
   - Reads the actual built `dist/client/index.html` file
   - Extracts the real asset references (script and CSS)
   - Updates the Worker file with correct asset tags
   - Runs automatically after every build

3. **Updated `package.json`**: Modified build scripts to run the asset updater:
   ```json
   "build": "vite build && node scripts/update-worker-assets.js",
   "build:dev": "vite build --mode development && node scripts/update-worker-assets.js"
   ```

### Prevention
This solution **permanently prevents** the recurring asset reference issues because:

- Asset references are automatically synchronized after every build
- No manual intervention required
- Works for both development and production builds
- The script is fail-safe with clear error messages

### Usage

#### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
**GitHub Actions handles everything automatically:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
# ðŸš€ Asset synchronization + deployment happens automatically!
```

See [`GITHUB-ACTIONS-SETUP.md`](GITHUB-ACTIONS-SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

#### Manual Deployment (Fallback)
Run the normal build command - the asset update happens automatically:
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

The script will output confirmation:
```
ðŸ”§ Updating Worker asset references...
ðŸ“„ Found assets:
  Script: /assets/index-BOWq5qFz.js
  CSS: /assets/index-C53w8djc.css
âœ… Worker asset references updated successfully
```

## GitHub Actions Automation

**Latest Enhancement**: The asset reference synchronization is now fully automated through GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch automatically:

1. âœ… Builds the application with fresh asset hashes
2. âœ… Runs the asset synchronization script
3. âœ… Sets CloudFlare Workers secrets (including Supabase authentication)
4. âœ… Deploys to CloudFlare Workers with correct references
5. âœ… Provides immediate feedback on deployment success

**Benefits:**
- Zero manual deployment steps required
- Asset reference issues can never recur
- Quality gates prevent broken deployments
- Safe branching (only `main` triggers deployment)

This completely eliminates the risk of asset reference mismatches and the time/token waste they caused.

## Environment Variables & Secrets

**Production secrets are now managed via GitHub Actions**, providing secure deployment without exposing sensitive keys:

- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Database authentication (set via GitHub secret)
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Deployment authorization (set via GitHub secret)
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Account identification (set via GitHub secret)

The workflow automatically configures these secrets during deployment, ensuring the production environment has all necessary credentials for database access and API functionality.

**Latest Update**: All 5 GitHub secrets are now configured for complete application functionality including maps, geocoding, and authentication.
