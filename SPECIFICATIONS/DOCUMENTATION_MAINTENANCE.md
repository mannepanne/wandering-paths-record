# Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

## When to Update SPECIFICATIONS/DEVELOPMENT.md

This checklist helps ensure the development documentation stays current with system changes.

### üö® **Immediate Update Required**

These changes **MUST** trigger a documentation update:

#### **Architecture Changes**
- [ ] New deployment platform or hosting changes
- [ ] Database schema modifications (new tables, major column changes)
- [ ] API endpoint additions, modifications, or removals
- [ ] Authentication/authorization system changes
- [ ] Third-party service integrations (new APIs, changed configurations)

#### **Development Workflow Changes**
- [ ] New environment variables or configuration requirements
- [ ] Build process or deployment command changes
- [ ] Development server setup modifications (ports, commands, etc.)
- [ ] New dependencies with setup requirements

#### **Major Feature Additions**
- [ ] New core functionality phases (Phase 4, 5, etc.)
- [ ] New UI components with significant functionality
- [ ] New data models or service layers
- [ ] Integration of new external services

### üìù **Update Recommended**

These changes should trigger documentation updates when convenient:

#### **Configuration Changes**
- [ ] Updated API keys or service configurations
- [ ] Performance optimization changes
- [ ] Security enhancement implementations
- [ ] Error handling or monitoring improvements

#### **Developer Experience**
- [ ] New debugging tools or techniques
- [ ] Updated troubleshooting solutions
- [ ] New testing procedures or scripts
- [ ] Development best practices changes

### üìä **Sections to Update by Change Type**

| Change Type | Update Sections |
|-------------|----------------|
| **New API Integration** | Tech Stack, API Architecture, Environment Setup |
| **Database Schema** | Database Setup, Core Components |
| **Deployment Changes** | Deployment, Environment Configuration |
| **New Major Features** | System Overview, Core Components, Architecture |
| **Development Workflow** | Development Workflow, Environment Setup |
| **Performance/Security** | Performance Considerations, Security & Compliance |

## üîÑ **Documentation Update Process**

### **Step 1: Identify Impact**
```markdown
What changed?
- [ ] Architecture/Infrastructure
- [ ] APIs/Services
- [ ] Development workflow
- [ ] Core functionality
```

### **Step 2: Update Documentation**
```markdown
Which sections need updates?
- [ ] System Overview
- [ ] Tech Stack
- [ ] Environment Setup
- [ ] Development Workflow
- [ ] API Architecture
- [ ] Database Setup
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Troubleshooting
```

### **Step 3: Validate**
```markdown
Documentation quality check:
- [ ] Accurate commands and URLs
- [ ] Current environment variables
- [ ] Working examples and tests
- [ ] Updated version information
- [ ] Reflect actual system state
```

## ü§ñ **Claude AI Reminders**

### **Automatic Triggers**
Add these to your mental checklist when working on code:

1. **Before major deployments**: "Does DEVELOPMENT.md reflect the current system?"
2. **After adding new services**: "Are the new APIs documented?"
3. **When changing workflows**: "Will other developers know how to work with this?"
4. **After environment changes**: "Are setup instructions current?"

### **Documentation Quality Standards**
- **Accuracy**: All commands and URLs must work
- **Completeness**: Include all steps for a new developer
- **Currency**: Reflect the actual current system state
- **Clarity**: Use clear, actionable language

### **Review Triggers**
- Major milestone completions (Phase 4, 5, etc.)
- Monthly architecture reviews
- Before onboarding new developers
- After significant debugging sessions

## üìã **Monthly Documentation Review**

Set a monthly reminder to review:

1. **Environment Variables**: Are all current env vars documented?
2. **Commands**: Do all npm scripts and deployment commands work as documented?
3. **URLs**: Are production and development URLs correct?
4. **Architecture**: Does the system diagram match current reality?
5. **APIs**: Are all endpoints and integrations documented?
6. **Troubleshooting**: Are solutions current and effective?

**Remember**: Documentation is a development deliverable, not an afterthought. Current documentation saves hours of debugging and onboarding time.
