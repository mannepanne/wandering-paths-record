# Geocoding API Setup

## Current Status
The Phase 3 Smart Geo Search implementation is complete and fully operational with Google Geocoding API integration.

## Google Cloud Console Configuration

The Google Maps API key has been properly configured with the following APIs enabled:

1. **Maps JavaScript API** ✅ (enabled)
2. **Geocoding API** ✅ (enabled)

### API Key Configuration:

- **Geocoding API**: Enabled ✅
- **Application Restrictions**: None (required for server-side CloudFlare Workers API calls)
- **HTTP Referrer Restrictions**: Removed (server-side APIs cannot use referrer restrictions)

## Testing

The geocoding works globally for any location. Test examples:
- **"asylum road"** → Precise coordinates (51.4771, -0.0584) in Peckham, London
- **"borough market"** → Precise Google coordinates for Borough Market
- **"monument"** → Precise coordinates for Monument station
- **"champs élysées paris"** → Works internationally
- **"times square new york"** → Global geocoding support

The system uses real Google Geocoding API data and falls back to city-wide results if no nearby restaurants are found.

## API Costs

Once enabled, the Geocoding API costs approximately $5 per 1000 requests. For development and moderate usage, this should be very affordable.
