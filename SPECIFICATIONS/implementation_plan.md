### **Phase 4: Enhanced Search & Filtering** - ‚úÖ **TEXT SEARCH COMPLETE**
**Status**: **TEXT-BASED SEARCH FULLY OPERATIONAL, NEAR ME PENDING**

#### ‚úÖ 4.1 Basic Filtering - **COMPLETE**
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Cuisine-based filtering with database-driven options
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Status filtering (must-visit/visited)
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Real-time filter updates with React Query

#### ‚úÖ 4.2 Text-Based Search - **COMPLETE** 
**Simple database text search against existing fields - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Search Target Fields:**
- Restaurant name (`restaurants.name`) ‚úÖ
- Address summary (`restaurants.address`) ‚úÖ
- Works with existing location data in database ‚úÖ

**Implementation Completed:**
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Text search integrated into existing location search input
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: PostgreSQL `ilike` query against name and address fields
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Uses `restaurants_with_locations` view for comprehensive search
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Real-time search results with React Query integration

**Example Searches Working:**
- "London" ‚Üí matches restaurants with London in address ‚úÖ
- "Shoreditch" ‚Üí matches restaurants in Shoreditch ‚úÖ
- "Peckham" ‚Üí finds Peckham Cellars and Peckham Bazaar ‚úÖ
- "Cellars" ‚Üí finds Peckham Cellars ‚úÖ

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `restaurantService.getFilteredRestaurants()` to accept `searchText` parameter
- Updated React Query integration in Index.tsx with text search state
- Simplified location search handler to use text matching instead of geocoding
- Clean separation between text search and location-based filtering

#### üîÑ 4.3 Near Me Search - **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
**Geocoding + radius-based filtering for 20-minute walking distance**

**Requirements:**
- [ ] **COORDINATE POPULATION**: Ensure restaurant addresses have lat/lng coordinates
- [ ] **GEOCODING**: Convert user's current location to coordinates
- [ ] **DISTANCE CALCULATION**: Filter restaurants within ~1.6km (20min walk at 5km/h)
- [ ] **DATABASE INTEGRATION**: Use existing `restaurants_with_locations` view

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] **STEP 1**: Run geocoding utility to populate missing coordinates
- [ ] **STEP 2**: Implement user location capture (GPS)
- [ ] **STEP 3**: Distance-based filtering using Haversine formula
- [ ] **STEP 4**: UI feedback for "Near Me" search results

#### ‚úÖ 4.4 Issues Resolved
**Problem**: The existing "location search" was trying to do both text search AND near me functionality in one complex system

**Solution Implemented**: Split into two separate, simple functions:
1. **Text Search**: Database text matching (no geocoding needed) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
2. **Near Me**: GPS + coordinate distance filtering (geocoding needed only for user location) ‚è∏Ô∏è **PENDING**

#### üìã Phase 4 Implementation Status

**‚úÖ STEP 1: Implement Simple Text Search** - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Text search integrated into existing FilterBar location input
- [x] Restaurant service updated with `searchText` parameter
- [x] PostgreSQL `ilike` search across restaurant name and address fields
- [x] Successfully tested with "London", "Shoreditch", "Peckham", restaurant names

**‚è∏Ô∏è STEP 2: Fix Near Me Functionality** - **PENDING** 
- [ ] Run geocoding utility to populate restaurant address coordinates
- [ ] Implement user geolocation capture for "Near Me" button
- [ ] Re-enable distance-based filtering in restaurant service
- [ ] Test with actual GPS location

**‚úÖ STEP 3: Clean Up Implementation** - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Removed complex geocoding logic from text search
- [x] Simplified location search to be pure text-based
- [x] "Near Me" button ready for GPS-based radius search implementation

**Current Status**: Text search is fully operational and working perfectly. Near Me functionality is ready to implement when coordinates are populated in the database.
