# Restaurant Dashboard & Visit History - Product Discovery

**Status:** Discovery phase - validating problem space
**Date:** February 2026

## Back to Your Restaurant Dashboard Needs

You've identified two related but distinct opportunity areas:

**A. Planning Dashboard** → "What should I visit next?"
- Recent additions (that you've forgotten about)
- Recent visits (to avoid or revisit)
- Context-aware discovery

**B. Visit History/Journaling** → "Track my dining journey"
- Multiple visits/ratings per restaurant
- Opinion evolution over time
- Visit logs with notes

Before we design anything, let's apply **Framestorming** - challenge the question before solving it.

## The Real Jobs to Be Done

Let me reframe this around your actual behavior:

**Current reality:**
- You add restaurants at a decent rate (maybe 2-5/week?)
- You visit restaurants regularly (maybe 1-3/week?)
- List is growing faster than you can visit
- You're losing track of what you've added recently
- You can't capture second visits properly

**The pain you're experiencing:**
1. **Discovery friction:** "I want to go out tonight, what did I added recently that I forgot about?"
2. **Visit logging limitation:** "I went to X again and my opinion changed, but I can only rate it once"
3. **Pattern blindness:** "I don't know which restaurants I keep going back to vs tried once"

## Critical Questions (Answer These First)

**1. Which problem causes more frustration day-to-day?**
- Not being able to find good restaurants to visit? (Discovery)
- Not being able to log multiple visits? (History)

**2. How do you currently decide where to eat?**
- Spontaneous ("I'm hungry now, what's nearby?")
- Planned ("I'll book for Saturday somewhere special")
- Exploratory ("I'm in this neighborhood, what's here?")

**3. When you revisit a restaurant:**
- How often does this happen? (Frequently? Rarely?)
- Why do you go back? (It's amazing? Convenient? Testing if first visit was a fluke?)
- What changes? (Different dishes? Different company? Season? Your standards evolving?)

**4. The visit log - what would you actually use it for?**
- Nostalgia/memory ("I remember that amazing October dinner")
- Analysis ("My taste is changing, I now prefer X over Y")
- Sharing ("Let me show you my food journey")
- Decision-making ("I've been 3 times and loved it every time = must recommend")

## My Hypothesis (Challenge Me on This)

Based on your description, I suspect:

**High Value:** Visit logging system
- Real data loss happening (can't capture second visits)
- Creates a personal record over time
- Enables tracking opinion evolution
- Solves a clear limitation of current system

**Medium Value:** Discovery dashboard
- Nice to have, but can be solved with better sorting/filtering?
- How often are you actually paralyzed by "what should I visit next?"
- Current filters might be 80% of the solution with 20% of the effort?

**But I need your input!** Tell me:

1. **Which problem makes you more frustrated?**
2. **If you could only build one first, which one?**
3. **What's the last time you thought "damn, I wish I could do X" with the app?**

Let's validate the real problem before we design the solution. This is Step 1 of Elon's process: **Make the requirements less dumb** by making sure we're solving the right problem.

What's your gut reaction? 🤔
